## üîç The Problem We're Solving

Ever felt frustrated with online forms? They're often:
* Too generic and don't adapt to your needs
* Provide no insights about the responses you're getting
* Leave you guessing about what actions to take
* Require manual effort to process and analyze
* Static and rigid - asking irrelevant questions regardless of previous answers

## üí° Our Solution

Formora transforms ordinary forms into intelligent conversations. Think of it as having a smart assistant that not only collects information but also helps you understand what that information means and what you should do with it. The best part? The form actually adapts and changes based on previous answers - just like a real conversation!
